<h2>Our API is open for developers <small>2016-09-01</h2>

We have opened up our [API][api] for developers. It is intended to
be used in applications that do **not** wish to re-implement
calculations on money transactions.
It is quite minimal and currently in development. We welcome
contribution to improve it. Head over to our [Github repository][repo].
